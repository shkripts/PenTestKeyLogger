3.4 THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES, SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, AND APPLICATION PROGRAMING 
INTERFACE

The Service may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to 
the Keiser Sites or 
other Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us, and Keiser does 
not endorse or make 
any representations about third party websites or social media platforms. We encourage you 
to read the privacy 
policies of each and every website and application with which you interact. We do not 
endorse, screen or approve, 
and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or 
applications. Visiting other 
websites or applications is at your own risk.

Keiser's Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, message 
boards, private messaging or 
video chat features. The Services may also contain links and interactive features with 
various social media or 
music platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set 
on your device when 
using the Services. You should be aware that Personal Information that you voluntarily 
include and transmit online 
in a publicly accessible blog, video chat session, social media platform or otherwise online, 
or that you share in 
an open forum, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to 
control such uses of your 
information when you interact with a third party platform, and by using such services you 
assume the risk that the 
Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any 
number of purposes.

We exchange information through the use of Application Programing Interfaces (APIs), with 
services such as Zwift, 
TrainerRoad and BKool, Google, Facebook, and others, through secured APIs. All data 
shared in this manner is an 
opt-in only function, we do not share personal information with any of these platforms 
without the user granting 
permission to share. All of these services use a technology called OAuth, which allows the 
date flow to be discontinued 
from either side of the connection (from the Keiser side, or the third party side of the 
exchange). As part of the API 
functionality of our Services, Keiser fitness equipment may use wireless data transfer 
capabilities such as Bluetooth
to facilitate pairing to devices using these APIs and other wearable devices. If you choose to 
link your Keiser account
 with such applications, you can decide to share the health information we collect about you 
while you use the Services, 
including, but not limited to, your heart rate, calories, cycling, walking and running distances, 
time spent working out,
 and the list of your Keiser workouts taken with such applications. If you decide to do so, you 
may also be able to transfer 
other personal information, such as your gender, date of birth, heart rate, height, weight and 
walking and running distances,
 from the health-related applications to Keiser. If you make this election, this information 
may be used by Keiser to update 
your Keiser User Profile and track your metrics in Keiser classes. You may opt-out of tracking 
at any time by configuring your 
privacy settings on such applications. We do not share information that we collect from APIs 
or other health-related applications 
with third parties for their advertising or marketing purposes. Your interactions with APIs or 
other health applications are 
governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the service.
3.5 THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSING

When you make online or in person purchases through the Services, we Process your 
payments through a third party payment processor. 
In these instances, the third party payment processor may collect certain Financial 
Information from you to Process a payment on 
behalf of Keiser, including your name, email address, address and other billing information 
in which case the use and storage of 
your Financial Information is governed by the third party payment processor terms, 
conditions and privacy policies. Our treatment 
of any Financial Information that we may Process on your behalf, or that we receive from our 
payment processors, is subject to this
 Privacy Policy. Currently, we work with Stripe, Affirm, and Klarna to process payments. For
