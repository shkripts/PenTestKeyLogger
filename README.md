# PenTestKeyLogger
A fake employee login that key logs information to a text file

I created this python script to be used during pen testing. This is only the first iteration and 
has issues that need to be fixed before it meets all the standards needed to be safe and practical.
I do intend to work on this a little further but as of today here is what I have:

User is greeted with a fake privacy agreement; the privacy agreement is stored in the corresponding 
text file in the same folder. This file can be swapped out for a target specific agreement and display
whatever is needed for campaign. The script is set to destroy root at the 8-minute mark, this is 
in case the user is attempting to find some type of help or resource in filling out form (or actually
reading the long privacy agreement). A checkButton is on the user agreement page, if checked a button 
named agree apears and disapears depending on the value of the checkButton. My belief is that making the 
user "sign" a privacy agreement would give a sense of authority and might help the user become complacent
in filling out the forms.

When the user clicks agree, they are then presented with a Fake login screen. The background can be
a logo or anything the pen tester chooses. (The background png easily swapped out for 
any company logo.) Once the user has entered the company location, username and login, the 
information then gets logged to a dictionary named Employee. The user is than taken a page named 
Update Contact info. Here the header is whatever company location the user entered previously.

There the user reads a brief statement on why the information is needed. The page follows with a request 
for more information. Once the user enters first & last name, address, and birth date the information is 
stored in a dictionary name Personal. The user then clicks on a button labeled 'next' and is prompted with a
warning: network error, try again in a few hours.

The button has also executed the payload and has written both employee and personal dictionary to 
the Payload.text. once this is done and the user clicks ok on the warning root is destroyed and
the script closes itself.

Room for improvements. the script could use a complete overhaul, and be redesigned to look more like and app.
The text information being in plain text is a big security issue and definitely needs some type of encryption.
The script could also use implementation of things like allupper and isdigits. A feature that I would like to
add down the line is some type of Smtp protocol or better. Once the file encryption is solved, I will move on 
to this next step.

Ideally the text file created needs to be encripted before features like smtp could be added.
